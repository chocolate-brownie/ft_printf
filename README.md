# ft_printf
ft_printf, that mimics the behavior of the standard printf function in C

### **Objective**

The primary goal of the ft_printf project is to create a function, `ft_printf`, that mimics the behavior of the standard `printf` function. This involves handling various format specifiers and producing formatted output. The project aims to:

1. **Understand formatted output:** Learn how formatted output works and how to handle different data types and formatting options.
2. **Work with variadic functions:** Understand and implement functions that accept a variable number of arguments.
3. **Enhance problem-solving skills:** Tackle a complex problem that involves multiple facets of C programming.
4. **Practice modular programming:** Develop skills in writing modular, reusable code that can be easily tested and extended.

### **Project Structure**

The ft_printf project is generally divided into several key components:

#### **Basic Format Specifiers**

Students need to handle basic format specifiers that cover common data types and formatting requirements:

- **%c:** Character
- **%s:** String
- **%d:** Signed decimal integer
- **%i:** Signed decimal integer (same as %d)
- **%u:** Unsigned decimal integer
- **%x:** Unsigned hexadecimal integer (lowercase)
- **%X:** Unsigned hexadecimal integer (uppercase)
- **%p:** Pointer address
- **%%:** Percent sign

### **Challenges and Complexity**

The ft_printf project presents several challenges, such as:

- **Handling variadic arguments:** Managing variable arguments correctly and efficiently.
- **Implementing precision and width:** Correctly interpreting and applying precision and width specifiers to various data types.
- **Managing edge cases:** Ensuring the function behaves correctly across a wide range of input scenarios.
- **Ensuring performance:** Writing code that is not only correct but also performs well, especially for frequently used functions like printf.

### **Evaluation Criteria**

The ft_printf project is evaluated through peer review, with a focus on several criteria:

- **Correctness:** Does the implementation produce correct output for all specified format specifiers and flags?
- **Code quality:** Is the code well-organized, readable, and maintainable?
- **Edge case handling:** Does the code handle all required edge cases and invalid inputs gracefully?
- **Performance:** Is the implementation efficient and performant?
